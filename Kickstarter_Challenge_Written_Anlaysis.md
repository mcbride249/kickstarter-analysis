Module 1 – Kickstarting with Excel Challenge

1. Overview of Project

Purpose: General
    The purpose of this project was to analyze how funding goals and launch dates impacted Kickstarter campaigns, more precisely as they related to theatre play performances, but could similarly be applied to any category or subcategory within the data set. 

Purpose: Analysis Based on Launch Date
    The analysis of “Outcomes Based on Launch Date” compared the success, failure, and cancelled rates of the theatre plays against the month in which they were launched, to determine if there was any correlation or trends in the data from which conclusion could be drawn to better predict what time Kickstarter campaigns should be launched in the future.  

Purpose: Analysis Based on Goals
    Similarly, the analysis of “Outcomes Based on Goals” looked for a correlation between the initial Kickstarter goal and the number of successes, failure, and cancelled rates of the theatre plays, again to determine if there were any trends as to what may influence them.

Challenges Encountered
    I am not sure I had any specific challenges in formatting and refining the data (assuming it is correct). The biggest issued I faced was the implementation of the “Count If” formula and coupling it multiple times in one cell. However, a quick Google search as well as the “trial and error” method allowed me to understand how to use the formula and implement it in the spreadsheet. I believe my biggest challenge and the biggest challenge faced by anyone, would come in the form of the analysis of the data itself, and extracting specific meaning from it. Initially, I thought that the data would be self-explanatory, and to a certain extent it is in so far as it clearly shows what month and what funding goals provided led to the most successful plays. However, when I began to look for reasons as to why this was the case, I found the data limiting for a precise explanation, in that it did not provide the granularity necessary to determine what it was specifically about the plays or those contributing to the plays as to what led them to contribute to those funding goals and within those months.


3. Results

What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    The two conclusions that one can draw about the outcomes based on launch date are that the most successful theatre kickstarters were launched in the spring/summer timeframes, particularly during the months of May and June. In a similar vein, we can also see that the corresponding failure rate also peaked around this time. Proportionally however, we can see that the failure rate actually stays constant around 36%, with the highest proportion of failing kickstarters occurring in December with a failure rate or 46%.

What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
    We can conclude from the outcomes based on goals that the kickstarters that get funded usually have a lower goal threshold. We can see both from the number of successful and percentage of successful kickstarters that as the goal amount increases, there is a corresponding increase in the likelihood of the campaign failing. 

What are some limitations of this dataset?
    The limitations of this data set are that it does not provide any insight into factors that detail why these plays were successful or failed. For example, both the number of successful and failed plays occurred around May-June timeframe, implying that these months would be the best time to launch a Kickstarter; despite this however, when we analyze the data based on percentages, we can see that the rate of successful kickstarters only increases by a rate of 5-6%. We can postulate however as to why this could be true; we know that December has the lowest successful Kickstarter rate and the highest failed rate, which could lead to some conclusions that persons are less likely to contribute to theater kickstarters as it is the Christmas season. However, there is no strong causal link between them as there is no data outlining why anyone has decided to contribute to a particular Kickstarter, which limits our knowledge as to why there is a corresponding increase or decrease in the number of successfully funded kickstarters beyond a correlation analysis. Furthermore, the data does not provide any insight into the people who are contributing, their donation level, whether they have contributed before, or their specific interest in the subject. Along a similar vein, the data does not provide any insight into specific details of the subcategories, in this case the plays, such as their genre, length, or its specific location within a country, all of which may have had an influence on their success rates. 

What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    As mentioned previously, we could gain more insight into the dataset by creating a table/graph detailing the proportion of failed, successful, and cancelled plays by month for outcomes by launch date. An analysis of this method would indicate that the proportion of failed and successful kickstarters actually remains somewhat constant throughout the year (there are months that do have an increase and decrease) and we could also use this data to see if the range of in change between months is actually statistically significant and thereby conclude if the number of successful/failed campaigns are just proportional to the number of kickstarters launched.
